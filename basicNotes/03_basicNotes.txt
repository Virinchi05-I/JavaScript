JavaScript Excecution Context
    
    Global Excecution Context

    Eval Excecution Context

how does JavaScriptexecute code :
1. Global Execution Context 
2. Memory Phase 
    all variable are gathered and assigned `undefined` 
    any function will have its definition saved in tthe memory 
3. Execution Phase
    values which are assigned to the variable in the code is saved in the memory
    function call ==> (new variable environment + execution thread)

    This will work till every variable and function is executed.
