Events:
    eventListener
    why not to use onClick in the html tag or directly with the document without using addEventListener()?,
    addEventListener(event, callback function: function(e){}, true/false),
    e is event object

    attachEvent(), 
    jQuery()

    diff types of events : click, keydown......

    topics to learn in event:
    type(like keyboard event and mouse event), timestamp, preventDefault,
    target, toElement, srcElement, currentTarget,
    clientX, clientY, screenX, screenY
    altkey, ctrlkey, shiftkey, keyCode 
            
    Event Propagation : Event Bubling, Event Capturing, stopPropagation()
    what is event spill over ? how it can be prevented ? 
    
Async :
    Js is a synchronous & single threaded language and executes one line of code at a time

    Blocking code vs Non Blocking code, how does Asynchronus api call works, task queue and priority queue
    setTimeout, setInterval, clearTimeout, clearInterval and other async api calls and methods  

Api request : 
    XMLHttpRequest() -: .send(), .open(), onreadystateChange, this.responseText
    JSON: .parse(), .stringify

Promises: 
    how to create it ?? how to consume it ?
    resolve(), reject(), then(), finally(), catch(), response(), reject() 

    async, await (keyword)

    fetch(): how does it work ?? why was it introduced ??

Oops JS concept:
    Objects - object creation

    Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism
    
    Prototype - setPrototypeOf(), __proto__, injecting method inside a non primitive type 
    constructor, instanceof
    
    new, this,(keyword), super(), call(), bind(), setter(set), getter(get), defineProperty(), hasOwnProperty()...
    
    Lexical Scoping, Closure
